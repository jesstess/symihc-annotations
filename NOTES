podcast table field: individual_gender
======================================

This field is currently 'm' (male) or 'f' (female) as that's been the analytical
focus. Adding support for other gender identities is welcome.

Charley Parkhurst, One-eyed Whip
- Born anatomically female, lived life as male
- Gender in db is male; keep full story in mind when doing gender analysis

The True Story of the Chevalier d'Eon: Part 2
- Born anatomically male, lived life as both male and female
- Identified as female at end of life
- Gender in db is female; keep full story in mind when doing gender analysis

Some podcasts are about groups of women (e.g. "Four Flights of Female Aviators")
or about a specific woman as well as specific other individuals. If you are
analyzing gender representation in the podcasts, note that these group podcasts
will not have the `individual_gender` field set; this field is only set for
individuals.

podcast table field: on_individual
==================================

Typically, if a single person is in the title or is stated to be the focus in
the description, it's marked as about an individual.

When two or more specific people are the focus, it is not marked as about an
individual.

tag: African Americans
======================

Who was "Black Moses"?
- Marcus Garvey was not born in the United States, but he lived in the US as an
  adult and was influential in African American political and social
  movements. The `African Americans` tag is thus applied to this podcast.

The Amistad Mutiny
- The prisoners aboard La Amistad were not African American, but the resulting
  court case was heard by the US Supreme Court and the event influenced African
  American political and social movements.  The `African Americans` tag is thus
  applied to this podcast.

Madame Lalaurie and the Haunting of Royal Street
- The focus is on the white Madam Lalaurie and not the slaves she tortured, so
  this podcast doesn't have the `African Americans` tag.
