This repository houses a collection of scripts to annotate Stuff You Missed in
History Class podcasts so that we can answer questions like:

* What percentage of podcasts are about women?
* What are all of the podcasts on events and people in the 1950s?
* What are all of the podcasts on events and people in South America?

As these annotations are inputted manually, mistakes may happen;
patches welcome!


Dependencies
============

* python-feedparser
* sqlite3


Setup
=====

We can streamline this process if anyone besides me ends up using this
repository. :)

1. Run `python create_tables.py` to create the tables.

2. Run `python populate.py` to do basic processing of all new podcasts
   not already in the database. You can quit this script with Ctl-C at
   any time to save your work and pick back up later.

3. Run `python tags.py` to create tag entries.

4. Run `python set_tags.py` to set the tags for each tag processor
that has been defined.
